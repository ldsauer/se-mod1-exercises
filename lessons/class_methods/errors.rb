# What does an error look like when using Class Methods?
require 'pry'

class Dog

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def bark
    puts "#{@name} says, 'bark'."
  end

    puts "#{@name} says, 'bark'."

fluffy.bark
# => "Fluffy says, 'bark'."

## Uncomment each line of code, one at a time. What is the difference between teh two errors?
